what is  spark?
 it is  a general purpose in memory computation engine

 1:general purpose:
(before spark we use different tools for different purpose)
 data cleaning--pig
 query- hive
 ml -operation: mahout

After getting into the spark  each and everything we can perform  everything in spark itself
(data cleaning
sql
sparkmlib)

2:Computaton:
hadoop vs spark

hadoop provide 3 components
1:hdfs  (storage)
2:resoure manager
3:map_Reduce--computation

3 In -memory(ram)
spark does all computation in in memeory
spark is faster than map reduce( in  mapreduce each time input is taken from hdfs (from harddisk) it will get slower in spark because in-memory it just only 2 times 1 input and 1 output)

Benefits of apache spark?
1:fast( through in memory caching,and optimizes query execution spark can run fast analytics queries aganist data of any size)
2:developer friendly:(supports  multiple api java,python,scla,sql,R)
3:multiple workloads(ability to run multiple workloads, real time analytics ,ml and graph processing)
